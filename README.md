# BulkSMTPProxyChange


# Use this script to add a new SMTP Proxy address to every enabled user. A common need for this is when the client changes domain names. ex: corp.com to contoso.com . This does not overwrite the existing SMTP Proxy Address but simply adds a new one to match the new domain. This way users can receive mail to both Proxy Addresses.
